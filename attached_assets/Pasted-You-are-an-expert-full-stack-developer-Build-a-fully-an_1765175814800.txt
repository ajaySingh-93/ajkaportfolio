You are an expert full-stack developer. Build a **fully animated personal portfolio website** using:

- Next.js (latest, App Router)
- TypeScript (strict)
- three.js (for 3D visuals/scene)
- barba.js (for smooth page transitions)
- CSS (Tailwind or CSS Modules; pick one and set it up properly)

Overall goals:
- Gen-Z **dark rave theme** (neon, glitch, grain, cyberpunk vibes)
- Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Smooth but performant animations
- Clean, modular code structure
- Easy to customize content (skills, education, experience, projects, etc.)

------------------------------------------------
1. PROJECT SETUP
------------------------------------------------
- Use **Next.js App Router** with TypeScript.
- Set `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`.
- Configure a global layout with:
  - `<html lang="en">` and proper `<head>` metadata.
  - Global styles for dark theme.
- Install and configure:
  - `three` and `@types/three`
  - `barba.js`
  - (Optional but recommended) `framer-motion` for 2D UI animations.
- Use a clean, modern folder structure, for example:
  - `src/app/` for routes
  - `src/components/` for reusable UI components
  - `src/lib/` for helpers/config
  - `src/types/` for TypeScript interfaces

------------------------------------------------
2. THEME & VISUAL STYLE (GEN-Z DARK RAVE)
------------------------------------------------
Design requirements:
- Base background: **very dark** (near black) with subtle noise/grain texture.
- Accent colors: neon (e.g., neon purple, cyan, magenta, green).
- Use **glow effects**, gradients, and subtle glitches.
- Typography:
  - One bold, futuristic display font for headings.
  - One clean sans-serif font for body text.
- Hover effects on buttons/cards:
  - Scale, glow, or outline animations.
- Use **glassmorphism** / translucent panels for cards (skills, projects, etc.).
- Add subtle animated background:
  - Either a **three.js 3D scene** (e.g., floating shapes/particles reacting to mouse movement)
  - Or animated gradient + particles.

------------------------------------------------
3. PAGES & SECTIONS
------------------------------------------------
Use these main routes (App Router):

/ (Home)
- Hero section with:
  - Name: `<YOUR_NAME>`
  - Title: e.g., "Aspiring Software Developer" or "Full-Stack Dev & Problem Solver"
  - Short tagline in one line (editable).
  - Call-to-action buttons:
    - "View Projects"
    - "Download Resume" (placeholder link)
  - Include a **three.js 3D visual** (e.g., floating orb, polygonal head, or abstract rave object).
- Animated introduction text that fades/glitches in.

/about
- Section: "About Me"
  - Text placeholder: `<ABOUT_ME_TEXT>`
- Show a timeline / cards for:
  - Education (college, course, year, etc.)
  - Certifications / achievements (optional).
- Add a small fun fact / personality section (e.g., “I love hackathons, late-night coding, and EDM.”).
- Include a stylized avatar or silhouette graphic.

/skills
- Display skills as categorized groups:
  - Programming Languages
  - Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Next.js, etc.)
  - Tools & Platforms (Git, GitHub, VS Code, Replit, etc.)
- Use a **radial, grid, or tag-cloud style** layout with animated hover.
- Optionally show a skill level indicator (e.g., beginner/intermediate/advanced) in a clean way (no fake bars).

/projects
- Show a **grid of project cards**, each card including:
  - Project title
  - Short description
  - Tech stack used
  - Links: GitHub / Live demo (optional; placeholders are fine)
- On click of a card, show a **project detail** overlay or separate route with:
  - More detailed description
  - Screenshots (use placeholder images)
  - Role & responsibilities
  - Key learnings / outcomes
- Add subtle project entrance animations (staggered fade-in/slide-up).

/experience
- Timeline of internships, freelance work, or academic projects.
- Each entry:
  - Role
  - Organization (e.g., "Bireena Info Tech, Patna")
  - Time period
  - 3–4 bullet points describing responsibilities and achievements.
- Animate the timeline as the user scrolls.

/contact
- Simple contact form with fields:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Message
- Form should have:
  - Basic validation (required fields, email format).
  - Fake submit handler with success toast/snackbar or message (no real backend needed).
- Also display:
  - Email link
  - LinkedIn, GitHub, and other social icons (with hover glow).

------------------------------------------------
4. GLOBAL COMPONENTS & NAVIGATION
------------------------------------------------
- Create a **persistent top navigation bar**:
  - Logo / name on the left.
  - Links to: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact.
  - Highlight current route.
- Add a **mobile menu** (hamburger > full-screen menu with neon animation).
- Footer:
  - Short text: "© `<CURRENT_YEAR>` `<YOUR_NAME>`"
  - Social links repeated.

Unique Gen-Z feature:
- Add a **command palette** or shortcut:
  - Press `Ctrl + K` (or `Cmd + K` on Mac) to open a small modal.
  - Allows quick navigation to sections/pages.
- Optional: Add a small **"Now Playing"** pill (fake) referencing EDM/lofi for the rave vibe.

------------------------------------------------
5. ANIMATIONS & PAGE TRANSITIONS
------------------------------------------------
barba.js:
- Integrate **barba.js** for smooth page transitions between routes:
  - Fade + slide transitions.
  - Optionally a glitch effect or color wipe when navigating.

Other animations:
- Use `framer-motion` (if you choose to install it) or CSS transitions for:
  - Hero text entrance.
  - Cards hover states.
  - Section entrance on scroll (fade-up/stagger).

three.js:
- Implement a reusable `Scene` component:
  - Abstract shapes (e.g., torus, spheres, low-poly shapes) with neon emissive materials.
  - Subtle rotation and camera movement.
  - Responsive sizing (works well on mobile too; disable or simplify effects on very small screens for performance).

------------------------------------------------
6. DATA & CONFIG
------------------------------------------------
- Store portfolio content in a **config file** / TypeScript object(s), for example:
  - `src/data/profile.ts` for name, title, about.
  - `src/data/skills.ts` for skills array.
  - `src/data/projects.ts` for projects.
  - `src/data/experience.ts` for experience items.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for these data objects to ensure type safety.
- Make it easy to update text without touching layout logic.

------------------------------------------------
7. ACCESSIBILITY & PERFORMANCE
------------------------------------------------
- Use semantic HTML elements for sections (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`).
- Ensure sufficient contrast even with neon colors.
- Add `aria-label`s where needed (e.g., for icons, hamburger menu).
- Optimize three.js and animations:
  - Avoid extremely heavy scenes.
  - Limit animation complexity on mobile.
- Use Next.js `Image` component for any images.

------------------------------------------------
8. FINAL DELIVERABLE
------------------------------------------------
- Fully working Next.js + TypeScript portfolio with all routes and sections described above.
- All animations and transitions wired up (three.js, barba.js, basic motion).
- Clear instructions in a `README.md`:
  - How to run the project.
  - Where to edit content (skills, education, experience, projects, about text, links).
- Code should be:
  - Well-organized.
  - Commented where needed (especially for three.js and barba.js integration).
  - Easy for me to extend later.

Now, please generate the complete project, including file structure, all pages, components, and minimal styling consistent with the **Gen-Z dark rave** theme described above.
