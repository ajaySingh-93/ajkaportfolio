  about: `I'm a Gen-Z developer obsessed with creating immersive digital experiences. 
  I blend performance-first engineering with rave-inspired aesthetics to build web apps that don't just work—they feel alive.
  When I'm not coding, I'm probably producing lo-fi beats or exploring the metaverse.`,
