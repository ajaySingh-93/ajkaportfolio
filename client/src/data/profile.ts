  about: `I’m Ajay Kumar, a software developer in the making, passionate about building clean, usable and efficient applications. I enjoy understanding how systems work from end-to-end – from the database and APIs to the animations and user experience.

My journey started with C, C++ and Java basics in college, and then moved into web development, Python and data handling. I’ve worked on projects like a Medicine Distribution Management System (DAWAI NOW), a To-Do List app, and an EMI Calculator, which helped me understand real-world problem solving, database design and UI/UX.

Right now I’m focusing on improving my DSA, building full-stack projects, and exploring modern tools like Next.js, TypeScript and three.js to create immersive experiences on the web.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech, listening to music, or planning my next side project.`,
